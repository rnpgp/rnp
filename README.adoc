== Introduction

RNP is a set of OpenPGP (RFC4880) tools that works on Linux, macOS, Windows and
*BSD built with C++.

`librnp` is the library used by RNP for all OpenPGP functions, useful
for developers to build against, different from GPGME.

== Versioning

RNP follows the http://semver.org/[semantic versioning] syntax.

=== Checking versions

The output of `rnp --version` contains the `git` hash of
the version the binary was built from, which value is generated when
`cmake` runs. Consequently, a release tarball generated with `make
dist` will contain this hash version.

=== Historic information

The first version of rnp started at `0.8.0` to indicate its development
completeness (or lack thereof).

RNP originated as an attempt to modernize the NetPGP codebase originally
created by Alistair Crooks of NetBSD in 2016. RNP has been heavily rewritten,
and carries minimal if any code from the original codebase.
