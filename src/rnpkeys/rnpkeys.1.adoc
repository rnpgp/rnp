== NAME

RNPKEYS - OpenPGP key management utility.

== SYNOPSIS

*rnpkeys* [_--homedir_ _dir_] [_OPTIONS_] _COMMAND_

== DESCRIPTION

The _rnpkeys_ command-line utility is part of the _RNP_ suite and
provides OpenPGP key management functionality, including:

* key listing;
* key generation;
* key import/export; and
* key editing.


=== BASICS

By default, *rnp* will apply a _COMMAND_, additionally configured with _OPTIONS_,
to all _INPUT_FILE_(s) or _stdin_ if no _INPUT_FILE_ is given.

Depending on the input, output may be written:

* to the specified file with a removed or added file extension (_.pgp_, _.asc_, _.sig_); or
* to _stdout_.

Without the *--armor* option, output will be in binary.

If _COMMAND_ requires public or private keys, *rnp* will look for the keyrings in *~/.rnp*. The options *--homedir* and *--keyfile* override this (see below).

If _COMMAND_ needs a password, *rnp* will ask for it via *stdin* or *tty*,
unless the *--password* or *--pass-fd* option was specified.


By default, *rnpkeys* will use keyrings stored in the _~/.rnp_ directory.

This behavior may be overridden with the _--homedir_ option.

If _COMMAND_ needs a password, the command will prompt the caller
via _stdin_ or _tty_, unless the *--password* or *--pass-fd*
options were also used.

=== SPECIFYING KEYS

Most *rnpkeys* commands require a key locator or a filter,
representing one or more keys.

It may be specified in one of the following ways:

*userid*::
Or just part of the *userid*.
For *"Alice <alice@rnpgp.com>"*, the following methods are considered identical:

** _alice_
** _alice@rnpgp_
** _rnpgp.com_

*keyid*::
Or its right-most 8 characters. With or without _0x_ at the beginning and spaces/tabs inside. Such as:

** _0x725F6F2D6D5F6120_
** _"725F6F2D 6D5F6120"_
** _0x6D5F6120_

*key fingerprint*: The 40-character key fingerprint, such as:

** _"0x416E746F 6E537669 72696465 6E6B6F20"_



== COMMANDS

=== INFORMATIONAL

*-h*, *--help*::
Displays a short help message. No options are expected.

*-V*, *--version*::
Displays version information. No options are expected.

*-l*, *--list-keys*::
List out keys and some brief information about each. +
+
Additional options:

*--with-sigs*:::
Additionally display signatures of listed keys.


=== KEY GENERATION

*-g*, *--generate-key*::
Generate a new keypair. +
+
Without additional options, an RSA primary key pair with an RSA sub-key pair will be generated, and prompting for the encryption password afterwards.
+
Additional options:

*--numbits*:::
Overrides the default RSA key size of *2048* bits.

*--expiration* _TIME_:::
Set key and subkey expiration time, counting from the creation time. +
+
By default generated keys do not expire. +
+
Expiration time can be specified as:

* expiration date in the ISO 8601:2019 date format (_yyyy-mm-dd_); or
* hours/days/months/years since creation time with the syntax of _20h_/_30d_/_1m_/_1y_;
* number of seconds.

*--expert*:::
Select key algorithms interactively and override default settings.

*--userid*:::
Specifies the _userid_ to be used in generation.

*--hash*:::
Specify the hash algorithm used in generation.

*--cipher*:::
Specify the encryption algorithm used in generation.

*--s2k-iterations*:::
Specify the number of iterations for the S2K (string-to-key) process. +
+
This is used during the derivation of the symmetric key, which
encrypts a secret key from the password. +

*--s2k-msec*:::
Specify that *rnpkeys* should automatically pick a
*--s2k-iterations* value such that the single key derivation operation
would take _NUMBER_ of milliseconds on the current system. +
+
For example, setting it to _2000_ would mean that each secret key
decryption operation would take around 2 seconds (on the current machine).


=== KEY/SIGNATURE IMPORT

*--import*, *--import-keys*, *--import-sigs*::
Import keys or signatures. +
+
While *rnpkeys* automatically detects the input data format,
one may still wish to specify whether the input provides keys or signatures. +
+
By default, the import process will stop on the first discovered
erroneous key or signature. +
+
Additional options:

*--permissive*:::
Skip errored or unsupported packets during the import process.

=== KEY/SIGNATURE EXPORT

*--export-key* [*--userid*=_FILTER_] [_FILTER_]::
Export key(s). Only export keys that match _FILTER_ if _FILTER_ is given. +
+
If filter matches a primary key, the subkeys of the primary key are also exported.
+
By default, key data is written to _stdout_ in ASCII-armored format.
+
Additional options:

*--output* _PATH_:::
Specifies output to be written to a file name instead of _stdout_.

*--secret*:::
Without this option specified, the command will only export public key(s).
This option must be provided to export secret key(s).

*--export-rev* _KEY_::
Export the revocation signature for a specified secret key. +
+
The revocation signature can be used later in a case of key loss or compromise.
+
Additional options:

*--rev-type*:::
Specifies type of key revocation.

*--rev-reason*:::
Specifies reason for key revocation.


=== KEY MANIPULATION

*--revoke-key* _KEY_::
Issue revocation signature for the secret key, and save it in the keyring. +
+
Revoked keys cannot be used further. +
+
Additional options:

*--rev-type*:::
Specifies type of key revocation.

*--rev-reason*:::
Specifies reason for key revocation.


*--remove-key* _KEY_::
Remove the specified key. +
+
If a primary key is specified, then all of its subkeys are also removed. +
+
If the specified key is a secret key, then it will not be deleted without
confirmation.
+
Additional options:

*--force*:::
Forces removal of a secret key without prompting the user.


=== OPTIONS

*--homedir* _DIR_::
Change homedir (where RNP looks for keyrings) to the specified value. +
+
The default homedir is _~/.rnp_ .

*--output* _PATH_::
Write data processing related output to the file specified. +
+
Combine it with *--force* to overwrite file if it already exists.

*--userid* _USERID_::
Use the specified _userid_ during key generation and in some
key-searching operations.

*--numbits* _BITS_::
Specify size in bits for the generated key and subkey. +
+
_bits_ may be in range *1024*-*16384*, as long as the public key algorithm
does not place additional limits.

*--cipher* _ALGORITHM_::
Set the key encryption algorithm. This is only used in key generation. +
+
The default value is _AES256_.

*--hash* _ALGORITHM_::
Use the specified hash algorithm for signatures and derivation of the encrypting key from password for secret key encryption. +
+
The default value is _SHA256_.

*--expert*::
Use the *expert key generation* mode, allowing the selection of
key/subkey algorithms. +
+
The following types of keys can be generated in this mode: +
+
--
** *DSA* key with *ElGamal* encryption subkey
** *DSA* key with *RSA* subkey
** *ECDSA* key with *ECDH* subkey
** *EdDSA* key with *x25519* subkey
** *SM2* key with subkey
--
+
Specifically, for *ECDSA* and *ECDH* the underlying curve can also be specified: +
+
--
** _NIST P-256_, _NIST P-384_, _NIST P-521_
** _brainpoolP256r1_, _brainpoolP384r1_, _brainpoolP512r1_
** _secp256k1_
--

*--pass-fd* _FD_::
Specify a file descriptor to read passwords from instead of from _stdin_/_tty_. +
+
Useful for automated or non-interactive sessions.

*--password* _PASSWORD_::
Use the specified password when it is needed. +
+
WARNING: Not recommended for production use due to potential security issues.
Use *--pass-fd* for batch operations instead.

*--with-sigs*::
Print signature information when listing keys via the *-l* command.

*--force*::
Force actions to happen without prompting the user. +
+
This applies to cases such as output file overwrite, secret key removal, and revoking an already revoked key.

*--permissive*::
Skip malformed or unknown keys/signatures during key import. +
+
By default, *rnpkeys* will stop on the first erroring packet
and exit with an error.

*--rev-type* _TYPE_::
Use the specified type during revocation signature generation instead of the default _0_. +
+
The following values are supported: +
+
--
** 0, or "no": no revocation type specified.
** 1, or "superseded": key was superseded with another key.
** 2, or "compromised": key was compromised and no longer valid.
** 3, or "retired": key is retired.
--
+
Please refer to *IETF RFC 4880* for details.

*--rev-reason* _REASON_::
Add the specified human-readable revocation _REASON_ to the
signature instead of an empty string.

*--s2k-iterations* _NUMBER_::
Specify the number of iterations for the S2K (string-to-key) process. +
+
This is used during the derivation of the symmetric key, which
encrypts a secret key from the password. +
+
Please refer to IETF RFC 4880 for further details.

*--s2k-msec* _NUMBER_::
Specify that *rnpkeys* should automatically pick a
*--s2k-iterations* value such that the single key derivation operation
would take _NUMBER_ of milliseconds on the current system. +
+
For example, setting it to _2000_ would mean that each secret key
decryption operation would take around 2 seconds (on the current machine).
